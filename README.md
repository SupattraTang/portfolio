## About me ðŸ‘‹

My name is Supattra or Pat. I believe that working as a Quality Assurance Engineer is my passion. It's similar to playing a game of identifying faults. Tester passion will stick their nose into any situation!

As a professional quality assurance engineer, I have experience designing and testing software development. I especially enjoy creating test plans, designing test coverage, and executing tests to guarantee that the entire system was executed.
